# openroads analytics

Currently just a proof of concept/feasibility of using turf.js to do analytics
on the client side. Ultimately will be made isomorphic so that we can move to
running analytics on the server and storing results if necessary.

Try it:

```
DEBUG=or-analytics node index.js [openroads-api-url]/map data/municipality.json
```
